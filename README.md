## Information

A Library of useful algorithms for C programming to make your applications simple to understand and easy to use. 

## Algorithms

* [MDB](https://github.com/skalaouzis/GraphsLib/blob/master/MDB) : This program accesses the BugTypes.mdb database, creates a dataset, adds the tables to it, and displays the number of tables, columns, and rows. It also displays the titles of each row.

* [PolynomialRoot_NewtonMethod](https://github.com/skalaouzis/GraphsLib/blob/master/PolynomialRoot_NewtonMethod.cpp) :  is a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function

* [ReadFile](https://github.com/skalaouzis/GraphsLib/blob/master/ReadFile.cpp) : read a file in c

* [dijkstra](https://github.com/skalaouzis/GraphsLib/blob/master/dijkstra.cpp) : shorthest path in the DAG

* [factorial](https://github.com/skalaouzis/GraphsLib/blob/master/factorial.cpp) : the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n

* [quicksort](https://github.com/skalaouzis/GraphsLib/blob/master/quicksort.cpp) : Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959
